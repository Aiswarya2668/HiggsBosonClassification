# HiggsBosonClassification
This project implements a machine learning model for the classification of Higgs Boson particles, using data from the Kaggle competition on particle physics. The goal of this project is to predict the presence of a Higgs Boson in particle collisions based on a set of features that represent the behavior of the particles.

## Key Features:
Data Processing: Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy.
Feature Engineering: Exploration and transformation of features to enhance model performance.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilization of grid search and cross-validation techniques to improve model accuracy.
Data:
The dataset used is available from Kaggle Higgs Boson Kaggle Challenge.
## Technologies:
Python
pandas, NumPy
scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
